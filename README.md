# Summary

## 2021 Provisional Results at the statistical subsection level

As part of the 2021 Census, the Geographic Information Reference Base (BGRI 2021) was created, a geographic infrastructure that divides the national territory into small areas for statistical purposes.

In an unprecedented way, and also in the context of the dissemination of provisional Census results, INE developed a geopackage consisting of information on the Provisional Results of the 2021 Censuses in terms of counting buildings, accommodations, households and individuals associated with the geographic component of the BGRI 2021 (statistical section and subsection).

The availability of this information enables the study and characterization of realities at a detailed geographical level, with relevance in several areas of intervention such as the preparation of risk management plans in the scope of civil protection or the planning of basic infrastructures.

Access to this 2021 geopackage is available on the INE Portal at:
